```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 w-10 h-10"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 w-10 h-10"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a flexbox container with two colored squares. However, if you're expecting the squares to be side-by-side, you might find they stack vertically instead.

The issue is that flexbox items default to taking up as much space as they need along the main axis (which is typically horizontal).  Since the squares have a `w-10 h-10` class specifying a width and height of 10 units each, this prevents them from fitting naturally next to each other. The default behavior is to stack them vertically.
